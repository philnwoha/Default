This example tries to (very loosly) follow the MVC pattern.

So we have a view (the windows form), a model (the "User" class) and a controller.

This ensures that should we decide to make this a web development project, all that really
changes is the view, but the model and controller will stay intact.

This took longer than expected because of some visual studio and nunit problems.
